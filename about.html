             <p> Inspired by mr Lomax' digital archive"; I have been wanting to start sharing some of my field recordings.

                 <p id="">So far all the uploaded audio files have been recorded on an Iphone. The name of the audio files should store the information of certain keywords in what is audible, the place it's recorded, date and recording devices e.g.: Iphone or Zoom. 
                     </p>
                     <p>I hope this will be of any use to you as a tool to create music or in any creative way. If you decide to use this for commercial use please contact me. </p>
